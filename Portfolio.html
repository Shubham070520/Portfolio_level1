                    <h2>CAD Design</h2>
                    <p>Computer-aided design (CAD) is a way to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D models of real-world products before they’re ever manufactured. With 3D CAD, you can share, review, simulate, and modify designs easily, opening doors to innovative and differentiated products that get to market fast.</p>

                    <h2>GD &amp; T</h2>
                    <p>
                        Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing is a set of rules and GD&T symbols used on a drawing to communicate the intent of a design, focusing on the function of the part. Using GD&T results in a more accurate design, larger tolerances for less important design features, and cost savings for manufacturing.

                    <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
                    <p>
                        3D modeling is the process of creating 3D objects using specialized software. These models can be staged with other visual effects to create entire scenes for still imagery or animation.
